Theoretical findings have shown that, in suitably defined large data limit, **BNNs posteriors are robust to gradient-based adversarial
attacks**.Thus, this study aims to demonstrate the theoretical robustness of Bayesian
neural architectures against multiple white-box attacks and list empirical findings
from the same.

Part of this work has been inspired by @kumar-shridhar github:PyTorch-BayesianCNN which was used to estimate robustness against five state-of-the-art Gradient-based attacks: -

### Layer types

This repository contains two types of bayesian lauer implementation:  
* **BBB (Bayes by Backprop):**  
  Based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424). This layer samples all the weights individually and then combines them with the inputs to compute a sample from the activations.

* **BBB_LRT (Bayes by Backprop w/ Local Reparametrization Trick):**  
  This layer combines Bayes by Backprop with local reparametrization trick from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02557). This trick makes it possible to directly sample from the distribution over activations.

#### Bayesian

`python main_bayesian.py`
* set hyperparameters in `config_bayesian.py`


#### Frequentist
